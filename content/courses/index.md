# Fall 2022

## CMPSC 203: Software Engineering

A human-centric study of the principles used during the engineering of high-quality software systems. In addition to examining the human behaviors and social processes undergirding software development methodologies, students participate in teams tasked with designing, developing, and delivering a significant software application for a customer. During a weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art software engineering, management, and communication tools to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

## CMPSC 311: Robotic Agents

A study of the design and implementation of autonomous software agents and robotic systems that cooperatively complete complex tasks. In addition to examining techniques for large-scale coordination and group-based decision-making, students learn how to apply the field's technologies to address the challenges facing local and global communities. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students develop and evaluate several multi-agent or multi-robot systems, while also reflecting on the civic issues surrounding the use of these systems. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.
