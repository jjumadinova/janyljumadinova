# Robotics Enrichment Program

## Engineering Robots: Build, Wire, Code!

Get ready to build your own robots from the ground up! In **Engineering Robots: Build, Wire, Code!** you'll design, assemble, and program robots that move, sense, and respond to the world around them. You will learn how different parts, including motors, sensors, and circuits, work together and bring your robot ideas to life through hands-on building and coding. No experience needed—just curiosity and creativity!

### Skills You'll Develop

- Building and wiring real robots using motors, sensors, and controllers
- Programming robots to move and react to their surroundings
- Problem-solving and teamwork through design challenges
- Creative thinking and perseverance while engineering your own designs

## Safety Reminders

- Always disconnect power before making circuit changes
- Check all connections with teacher before powering on
- Keep wires away from moving parts
- Use appropriate resistors to protect components
- Work carefully and ask questions if unsure
