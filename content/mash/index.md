# Crawford Central MASH

## High School Game Development: Tasks for March 31st

###  Main Task: Finish [First 2D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html)

- Last time we finished [Coding the player](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/03.coding_the_player.html)
- First, please verify your player is able to move around appropriately.
- Then, move on to [Creating the enemy](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/04.creating_the_enemy.html) and the following sections. 
- By the end of the session, you should aim to have a 2D game that is playable.

### Supplemental Task: Enhancing the game

- Start thinking of ideas to enhance the 2D game you have developed. How can you make the game a little bit your own?
- If you have time, start putting those ideas to practice. 
	
## High School Robotics: Tasks for March 31st

### Task 1: Robotic Races

We will hold robotic racing challenges! Last time you programmed your robot to be able to complete in a sprint and box pushing races. You could elect to develop either an ethical (e.g., respectful) or an aggressive (e.g., interfering) robot behavior. Today, we will actually run those races. **Everyone must participate for evaluation.**

#### Race Rules

All robots will begin on the same line. The end line will be marked with tape. 

1. **Sprint race:** Robots will race along a straight path for three meters until the end line is reached. The robot that reaches the end line _first_ wins.
2. **Push race:** Each robot will have a small box right in front of it (front center). The robot needs to push the box along a straight path for three meters until it pushes the box across the end line. The robot that pushes the small box across the end line _first_ wins.

### Task 2: Implement a dancing gopigo robot

After races are complete, use the remainder of the session, to begin developing a dancing `gopigo` robot. You will finish this project during our next session and will demonstrate it for evaluation.

#### Requirements

- Your robot must use a speaker and play music.
- Your code must use an `if` statement. Ask a teaching assistant for help with this task!
- Your code must use a loop (such as `for` or `while` loop). Ask a teaching assistant for help with this task!

To use the provided speakers, you can play any `mp3` sound you find by running the following code:
```
import pygame

pygame.mixer.init()    
pygame.mixer.music.load("music.mp3")
pygame.mixer.music.set_volume(1)
pygame.mixer.music.play()
# do something
pygame.mixer.music.stop()
```

### Reminder: Working with Robots

1. [Turn on battery and turn on the robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKPE6Sn8EKI&t=40s)
2. Connect to robot's wifi
3. Go to mygopigo.com and click on `Code` -> `Python`
4. Complete the activity 
5. [Shut down the robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=39&v=Co2i673mCQ4&embeds_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMzY4NDIsMzY4NDI&feature=emb_logo)
