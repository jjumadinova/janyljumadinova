# Robotics Enrichment Program

## Middle School "Robot + Game = ?" Majors Schedule

What happens when robots and games collide? In Robot + Game = ?, you'll step into the role of a robotics engineer and game developer, using a game engine to bring intelligent machines to life in virtual worlds. Design and simulate autonomous robots - like drones that navigate through dynamic environments, avoiding obstacles in real time. Through hands-on projects, you'll integrate LiDAR-based sensing and learning algorithms to develop robotic behavior. 

Learning Outcomes:

- Ability to use a game engine-based simulation to create and test robotic systems.
- Problem-solving and teamwork through iterative development and testing.

## Session 1

- [Introduction to Robotics](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lBvxaRCd3KU_Ci5lfe21iA764TSjV_uB2NCJ-5d7bz0/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)
- [Virtual Robot Movements](https://vr.vex.com/)
  1. File -> Open Examples, select `Drivetrain Moves and Turns`
  2. Study the code blocks, run the example
  3. SELECT PLAYGROUND -> Wall Maze
  4. Modify the code to make it to the finish
  5. Save (Ctrl + S) your program
- Object Sensing
  1. Open a new project
  2. File -> Open Examples -> Coral Reef Cleanup 3
  3. Test the example code
  4. Improve it
