      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am an Associate Professor in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://cis.allegheny.edu&#34;&gt;Department of Computer and Information Science&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&#34;https://allegheny.edu&#34;&gt;Allegheny College&lt;/a&gt;. I currently serve as the Chair of Computer Science and Integrative Informatics while also teaching a variety of courses in introductory programming, algorithms, software engineering, artificial intelligence, robotics, and security. I work with students on research project collaborations that produce publishable results, and supervise students on independent study projects, internships and senior thesis projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My research is driven by the goal to design autonomous systems that can improve our quality of life. The focus of my research is on solving problems that occur when performing dynamic and complex tasks in unknown environments. I hold a Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Management Information Systems, a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Mathematics and a Doctorate degree in Information Technology from the University of Nebraska at Omaha.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
